Simulation of dots :^

Rules
1. Matrix will determine the attraction/repulsion between particles
2. Attraction/repulsion will be calculated when particles are within a certain range
3. There'll be a default repulsion on the surface of particles to avoid particles sticking
4. Forces will be calculated where closer particles have higher forces and further have lower forces
4. a. Calculation through linear equation (y = mx + c) where y = force, x = distance
5. Forces will represent the distance needed to travel every increment of time
